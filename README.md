# ClusTorus
Clustering on The Torus by Conformal Prediction

This R package provides R functions to perform clustering multivariate angular data of any dimension on general tori. 

A part of the functions and data sets in this package was used to develop an unpublished paper "Clustering on the torus by conformal prediction" by Jung, Park and Kim. 

CRAN released version is not available now.

Install the development version from GitHub with:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("sungkyujung/ClusTorus")
```
If you also want to install the vignettes, then use the code:
```r
devtools::install_github("sungkyujung/ClusTorus", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

Your R version must be equal to, or larger than 3.6.0
