Clustering on The Torus by Conformal Prediction

This R package provides R functions to perform clustering multivariate angular data of any dimension on general tori. 

A part of the functions and data sets in this package was used to develop an unpublished paper "Clustering on the torus by conformal prediction" by Jung, Park and Kim. 

## Installation

```r
# install from CRAN
install.packages("ClusTorus")

# development version is available via this code:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("sungkyujung/ClusTorus")
