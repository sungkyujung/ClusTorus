Package: ClusTorus
Type: Package
Title: Clustering on the Torus by Conformal Prediction
Description: Provides various tools and options for clustering
  angle based data such as protein structures. The package 
  especially implements clustering algorithms under conformal 
  prediction framework, whose conformity scores are based on 
  multivariate von Mises sine distribution. Moreover, the package
  also provides some basic data handling tools for angular data.
