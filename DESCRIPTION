Title: Prediction and Clustering on the Torus by Conformal Prediction
Description: Provides various tools of for clustering multivariate angular 
  data on the torus. The package provides angular 
  adaptations of usual clustering methods such as the k-means 
  clustering, pairwise angular distances, which can be used as an 
  input for distance-based clustering algorithms, and implements
  clustering based on the conformal prediction framework. Options 
  for the conformal scores include scores based on a kernel density 
  estimate, multivariate von Mises mixtures, and naive k-means clusters. 
  Moreover, the package provides some basic data handling tools for 
  angular data.
