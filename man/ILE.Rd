\usage{
ILE
}
\description{
An isomer of leucine, essential branched-chain aliphatic amino acid found in many proteins.
}
\details{
ILE data is generated with collection of different pdb files. To select adequate protein
  data, we use PISCES server. (the method is introduced in articles of references.)
  To select high-quality protein data, we use several benchmarks:
  resolution : 1.6A(angstrom) or better,
  R-factor : 0.22 or better,
  Sequence percentage identity: <= 25%.
  Then, we select ILE only angular data for each protein data. To see the detail code, visit
