\title{toydata2: Labelled Data for 3 Clusters}
\format{
This \code{data.frame} contains the following components:

  \item{\code{phi}}{column for the first angle}
  \item{\code{psi}}{column for the second angle}
  \item{\code{label}}{column for the clustering membership}

\description{
Artificially generated data on the 2 dimensional torus
}
\details{
toydata2 is an artificial data generated from a mixture of 3 clusters,
  where the first cluster is sampled from a spherical normal distribution,
  the second cluster is from the uniform distribution on a large “L”-shaped region,
  and the third cluster of size 50 is sampled from the uniform distribution on the
  entire 2-dimensional torus.
